[![npm bundle size](https://img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/style-observer)](https://bundlephobia.com/package/style-observer)

A robust, production-ready library to observe CSS property changes.
Detects browser bugs and works around them, so you don't have to.

- <span>✅</span> Observe changes to custom properties
- <span>✅</span> Observe changes to standard properties (except `display`, `transition`, `animation`)
- <span>✅</span> Observe changes on any element (including those in Shadow DOM)
- <span>✅</span> [Lightweight](https://bundlephobia.com/package/style-observer), ESM-only code, with no dependencies
- <span>✅</span> [150+ unit tests](tests) you can run in your browser of choice
- <span>✅</span> Throttling (per element)

## Install

The quickest way is to just include straight from the [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) CDN:

```js
import StyleObserver from "https://observe.style/index.js";
```

This will always point to the latest version, so it may be a good idea to eventually switch to a local version that you can control.
E.g. you can use npm:

```sh
npm install style-observer
```

and then, if you use a bundler like Rollup or Webpack:

```js
import StyleObserver from "style-observer";
```

and if you don’t:

```js
import StyleObserver from "node_modules/style-observer/dist/index.js";
```

## Usage

You can first create the observer instance and then observe, like a `MutationObserver`:

```js
import StyleObserver from "style-observer";

const observer = new StyleObserver(callback);
const properties = ["color", "--my-custom-property"];
const targets = document.querySelectorAll(".my-element");
observer.observe(targets, properties);
```

Alternatively, you can provide both targets and properties when creating the observer,
which will also call `observe()` for you:

```js
import StyleObserver from "style-observer";

const observer = new StyleObserver(callback, {
	targets: document.querySelectorAll(".my-element"),
	properties: ["color", "--my-custom-property"],
});
```

Both targets and properties can be either a single value or an iterable.

Note that the observer will not fire immediately for the initial state of the elements.

## Future Work

- Observe pseudo-elements
- `immediate` convenience option that fires the callback immediately for every observed element
- Option to fire callback at the *end* of a transition
- Option to fire callback *during* transitions

## Limitations & Caveats

### Transitions & Animations

- You cannot observe `transition` and `animation` properties.
- You cannot observe changes caused by CSS animations or transitions.

### Observing `display`

Observing `display` is inconsistent across browsers (see [relevant tests](tests/?test=display)):

| Rule | Chrome | Firefox | Safari | Safari (iOS) | Samsung Internet |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| From `display: none` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| To `display: none` | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| From not `none` to not `none` |  ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

To observe elements becoming visible or not visible, you may want to take a look at [`IntersectionObserver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API).

### Changing `transition` properties after observing

If you change the `transition`/`transition-*` properties dynamically on elements you are observing after you start observing them,
the easiest way to ensure the observer continues working as expected is to call `observer.updateTransition(targets)` to regenerate the `transition` property the observer uses to detect changes.

If running JS is not an option, you can also do it manually:
1. Add `, var(--style-observer-transition, --style-observer-noop)` at the end of your `transition` property.
E.g. if instead of `transition: 1s background` you'd set `transition: 1s background, var(--style-observer-transition, --style-observer-noop)`.
2. Make sure to also set `transition-behavior: allow-discrete;`.

## Prior Art

The quest for a JS style observer has been long and torturous.

- Early attempts used polling. Notable examples were [`ComputedStyleObserver` by Keith Clark](https://github.com/keithclark/ComputedStyleObserver)
and [`StyleObserver` by PixelsCommander](https://github.com/PixelsCommander/StyleObserver)
- [css-var-listener](https://github.com/propjockey/css-var-listener) by [Jane Ori](https://propjockey.io) was the first to do better than polling, using a combination of observers and events.
- [css-variable-observer](https://github.com/fluorumlabs/css-variable-observer) by [Artem Godin](https://github.com/fluorumlabs) pioneered using transition events to observe property changes, and used an ingenious hack based on `font-variation-settings` to observe CSS property changes.
- Four years, later [Bramus Van Damme](https://github.com/bramus) pioneered a way to do it "properly" in [style-observer](https://github.com/bramus/style-observer),
thanks to [`transition-behavior: allow-discrete`](https://caniuse.com/mdn-css_properties_transition-behavior) becoming Baseline and even [blogged about all the bugs he encountered along the way](https://www.bram.us/2024/08/31/introducing-bramus-style-observer-a-mutationobserver-for-css/).

This is not a fork of either. It was written from scratch and has several differences, including:
- Actually detects browser bugs, so it doesn't need to tread carefully around them
- Integrates better with existing transitions
- Throttling and coalescing of changes
